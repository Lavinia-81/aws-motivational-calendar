# 🌍 AWS Cloud Practitioner Motivation & Quiz App

# 🎨 Why This Project Stands Out

This project is vibrantly designed and emotionally engaging, crafted to keep learners motivated and curious.
Through colorful gradients, dynamic interactions, and uplifting quotes, it transforms AWS certification prep into a journey of self-discovery.
The interface is intentionally playful and interactive, so users don’t just study—they enjoy the process and feel inspired to keep going.
